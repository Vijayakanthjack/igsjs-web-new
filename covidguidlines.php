                    <h2>What are some ways to prevent the spread of COVID-19?</h2>
                    <p>Avoid touching surfaces, especially in public settings or health facilities, in case people
                        infected with COVID-19 have touched them. Clean surfaces regularly with standard disinfectants.
                    </p>
                    <p>Frequently clean your hands with soap and water, or an alcohol-based hand rub.</p>

                    <h2>What are the COVID-19 guidelines for social distancing?</h2>
                    <p>If you have to be around people, maintain a distance of 2 meters or 6 feet from others around you
                        as much as possible. Not just mass gatherings, but even shopping malls, stadiums, and movie
                        theatres can make you a target. In general, any gathering of over ten people should be avoided
                        or conducted virtually.</p>
